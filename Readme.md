# LeetCode Solving For Training Rust

The goal of this process is to improve Rust proficiency.

## Requirements

1. A README file should be created arbitrarily, but a CHANGELOG file is not
   required.
2. Each problem should have a corresponding issue, and a PR should be submitted
   for it. The issue should include a link to the problem.
3. Once the reviewer approves, the merge is performed by oneself.
4. If modifications from the PR review process need to be applied to already
   merged code, a separate issue should be created and addressed.
5. External libraries should not be used.
6. If the problem's requirements are flexible, participants can decide how to
   proceed. The goal is to become familiar with Rust, rather than just solving
   problems.
